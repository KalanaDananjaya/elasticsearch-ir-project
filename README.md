## Indexing and Querying Techniques Used

### Rule Based Classification 

A rule based classification has been used to classify the user search queries into different types of searches. The search phrase is scanned both fully and token-wise for keywords and based on the keywords present, different rules are applied.
> Eg: If the phrase contains a number, do a range query and sort the result by views and return the best matching number of songs equal to the given number

### Boosting 

Boosting has been used as the main query optimization technique. Each field of a search is boosted by a certain value based on the keywords present in the search phrase.

> Eg: If the phrase contains the word “ගැයූ" boost the artist field

A basic representation of the rules are applied to each search phrase to identify the keywords, classify them into relevant search types and boost the relevant data fields is shown below.
